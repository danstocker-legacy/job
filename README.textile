h1. jOB

jOb is a simple benchmarking framework for JavaScript.

h2. Requirements

* jQuery

h2. Initialization

The benchmark page is constructed according to the information specified through the @benchmark@ and @test@ methods of the @jOB@ object, when the document ready event fires.

h2. Usage

h3. benchmark(description, labels...)

Registers a new benchmark. Each benchmark may run multiple tests on multiple candidates. Candidates are identified by their labels.

Example:
@jOB.benchmark("awesome speed improvement", "Old code", "My algorithm");@

h3. test(description, handler..., options)

Registers a benchmark test. The @handler@ argument specifies the function to be run for each candidate.

Handlers don't take arguments and are expected optionally to return an array of objects. The return value or its length will be displayed on the benchmark page upon manual execution. Which one, is controlled by the @lengthonly@ property of the @options@ argument object.

Example:
@jOB.test("DOM population", function () {/*...*/}, function () {/*...*/}, {lengthonly: true});@
